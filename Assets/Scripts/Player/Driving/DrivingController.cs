//GetAxis is a method (gives values from Input Manager). Horizontal is referenced in Input Manager.
//Strings are given words that a computer will understand. It's known as a string literal???
//transform.Translate is the method. In the method (void), Vector3 is the position, and the position is being multiplied by Time.deltaTime.
//Time.deltaTime is a time constant.
//Time.deltaTime is then being multiplied by the variable, speed, we just declared. In this case, our speed is 5.
//Rotate Method: Vector3.up is y-axis, then we need the angle which is Time.delta * timeSpeed, then * it be turnSpeed.
