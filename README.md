Dev Blog:
* 11/11/2021:
- Created the Unity Project and Github Repo.
- Made the GDD 
- 11:50 PM; I FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIX THE DAY NIGHT CYCLE'S PACING!! WOOSh

* 11/18/2021:
- Figured out the mashing mechanic (I still need to make it deaccelerate faster than it accelerates)
- I drew a character concept. I need to make the paper map & greybox.
- Package UI is in place. There needs to be a package script that adds weight to the player. The weight variable will slow the player's speed and mashing rate (you need to mash faster the heavier the package is).
